UTILITY
    - Our net gain/loss per play.
    - For example if we played rock and our opponent played paper then we would of had
      utility of -1 since we lost, a utlity of 0 if we played paper, and +1 if we played 
      scissors

REGRET
    - We regret actions that do not improve our utility. We regret taking an 
      action resulting in utility of 0, but we reget taking a -1 action even more.
    - To calculate reget we find the difference between an other action and the action
      we actually took. Example below.(higher number = higher regret)
      (This is diff from utility)
    - In our example, we play rock and the opponent plays paper, so to calculate possible
       regrets: (paper, paper) - (rock, paper) = 0 - (-1) = 1
              : (scissors, paper) - (rock, paper) = +1 - (-1) = 2

HOW MIGHT REGRET INFORM FUTURE PLAY
    - Naturally one is more likely to choose plays that he regretted in the past
    - However said person doesnt want to purely go by regret, because then he is easily
      predictable
    - We can accomplish this state is through REGRET MATCHING
      THIS IS WHERE AN AGENTS ACTIONS ARE SELECTED PROPORTIONAL TO POSITIVE REGRETS

CALCULATING CUMMULATIVE REGRET IN AN ARRAY STRUCT:
    let regret = [0, 0, 0] in the form [rock, paper, scissors]
    
    ROUND ONE:
        we choose rock and the opponent choose scissors:
            reg = [0, 0, 0]

    ROUND TWO:
        we choose paper and the opponent chooses scissors:
            reg = [2, 0, 1]

    ROUND THREE: 
        we choose scissors and the opponent chooses rock:
            reg = [1, 2, 0]

    CUMMULATIVE REGRET:
        reg = mixed strategy of [3/6, 2/6, 2/6] for next round
